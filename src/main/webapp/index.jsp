    <h1>Welcome to My First Website!</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of something exciting. I’m learning how to build websites, and this is my very first step into the world of web development.</p>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>Here you’ll find random text just to make the page look less empty. Sometimes, people use “Lorem Ipsum” filler text, but let’s keep it fun and simple.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The internet has over 1.8 billion websites.</li>
        <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</li>
        <li>Every website starts with just a blank page… like this one!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Random Quote</h2>
    <blockquote>
        "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." – Lao Tzu
    </blockquote>

    <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>I’ll soon learn how to add colors, images, and maybe even some interactive buttons. For now, I’m happy this page works!</p>
